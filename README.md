Attempt for NIP 60/61 (Nutwallet/NutZaps) implementation in Python

Work in Progress. Contributions welcome.

TODOs:
- History of spending logic should be saved
- Move coins between mints (melt/mint) (right now we mint new tokens from lightning, if proofs are not sufficient)

Known issues / Bugs:
Make Wallet only first, don't directly mint on first start.
